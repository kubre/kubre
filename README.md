## Hey there 👋

<p>

- As a pragmatic individual, I am passionate about creating and delivering products and services that users love. I am not someone who micromanages code but instead focuses on building and shipping quality products.
- I thrive in team environments and value open conversations to ensure the best possible outcomes. As a heavy user of Git, I am well-versed in processes that simplify programming and deployment.
- I am a firm believer in continuous learning and actively seek out opportunities to enhance my skills and knowledge. I am always eager to listen, learn and collaborate to achieve successful outcomes.
